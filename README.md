# Yours-property

- Built a Real estate webapp, which consists of Selling, Renting and Buying properties.
- Sellers can post their property advertisements on the portal only after authentication. 
- Buyers can view all the listed properties without the need of signing in.
- Sellers can remove their properties if they sold it/no longer want to sell them.
- The buyer will need to buy a subscription to see the seller’s contact information.
- Whenever an authenticated buyer clicks on the Contact-Seller button, the buyer and seller should get each other’s information.
